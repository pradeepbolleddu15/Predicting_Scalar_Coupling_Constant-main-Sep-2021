# Predicting_Scalar_Coupling_Constant

Medical Researchers around the world exploit the properties of the molecules 
to understand its structure and chemi- cal behavior which helps them to design 
molecules to carry out specific task and produce new drugs to fight deadly disease. 
The knowledge of magnetic interactions between the atoms of molecule i.e. Scalar 
Coupling Constant helps them to infer various properties of molecules. 
However, calculat- ing these interaction via tradition quantum mechanics 
methods is time consuming and computational extensive, which opens up the 
research for other predicting methodologies like statistical machine learning 
and deep learning algorithms. In addition, the domain of variables involves could 
be narrowed down via feature selection algorithms and transfer learning.

## Project File Description

1. **Data_Preprcessing.ipynb**: This notebook consists of code for Data Exploration & Wrangling
to create a final dataset required for training various Neural Network Architecture and Machine Learning models.

2. **Neural_Net_Training.ipynb**: Resulting `dataset.csv` file is being used in this notebook for various 
neural network architectures. Moreover, this notebook also comprises of multifarious experiments and respective 
visual results as discussed in project paper.

3. **Machine_Learning_Models.ipynb**: This notebook hosts the code required for conducting machine learning experiements 
with the data.

## Instructions for Running

* It is advisable to first dowload the data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling)
* `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` should be first executed which will produce the pre-processed data csv file 'dataset.csv'
* Remaining two notebooks could be executed in any order. All the relevant results and graphs visualization are present in the
respective jupyter notebook files.
